# Description

This application utilizes the Petfinder API, where users can answer a series of questions to display pets that match their preferences.
I developed both the front-end and back-end of this application. 
For the front-end development, I used ReactJs and tailwindCSS, while Node.js was used for the back-end development.
I learned that by combining ReactJS with tailwindCSS, it was easier to create a responsive website.
The reason for separating front-end and back-end development was due to the Petfinder API's use of CORS and OAuth,
which cannot be directly called from the front-end. Therefore, I used the web service "Render" to access the API.
