# Pet Matching Application

https://pet-matching-app.vercel.app/

### Description

This application utilizes the Petfinder API, where users can answer a series of questions to display pets that match their preferences. I developed both the front-end and back-end of this application. For the front-end development, I used ReactJs and tailwindCSS, while Node.js was used for the back-end development. I learned that by combining ReactJS with tailwindCSS, it was easier to create a responsive website. The reason for separating front-end and back-end development was due to the Petfinder API's use of CORS and OAuth, which cannot be directly called from the front-end. Therefore, I used the web service "Render" to access the API.
